/**
 * An IRVariable refers to a set of yul variables that correspond to the stack layout of a Solidity variable or expression
 * of a specific Solidity type. If the Solidity type occupies a single stack slot, the IRVariable refers to a single yul variable.
 * Otherwise the set of yul variables it refers to is (recursively) determined by  @see ``Type::stackItems()``.
 * For example, an IRVariable referring to a dynamically sized calldata array will consist of two parts named
 * ``offset`` and ``length``, whereas an IRVariable referring to a statically sized calldata type, a storage reference
 * type or a memory reference type will contain a single unnamed part containing an offset. An IRVariable referring to
 * a value type will contain a single unnamed part containing the value, an IRVariable referring to a tuple will
 * have the typed tuple components as parts.
