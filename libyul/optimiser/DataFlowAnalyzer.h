/**
 * Base class to perform data flow analysis during AST walks.
 * Tracks assignments and is used as base class for both Rematerialiser and
 * Common Subexpression Eliminator.
 *
 * A special zero constant expression is used for the default value of variables.
 *
 * The class also tracks contents in storage and memory. Both keys and values
 * are names of variables. Whenever such a variable is re-assigned, the knowledge
 * is cleared.
 *
 * For elementary statements, we check if it is an SSTORE(x, y) / MSTORE(x, y)
 * If yes, visit the statement. Then record that fact and clear all storage slots t
 *   where we cannot prove x != t or y == m_storage[t] using the current values of the variables x and t.
 * Otherwise, determine if the statement invalidates storage/memory. If yes, clear all knowledge
 * about storage/memory before visiting the statement. Then visit the statement.
 *
 * For forward-joining control flow, storage/memory information from the branches is combined.
 * If the keys or values are different or non-existent in one branch, the key is deleted.
 * This works also for memory (where addresses overlap) because one branch is always an
 * older version of the other and thus overlapping contents would have been deleted already
 * at the point of assignment.
 *
 * The DataFlowAnalyzer currently does not deal with the ``leave`` statement. This is because
 * it only matters at the end of a function body, which is a point in the code a derived class
 * can not easily deal with.
 *
 * Prerequisite: Disambiguator, ForLoopInitRewriter.
