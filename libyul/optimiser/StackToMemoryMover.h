/**
 * Optimisation stage that moves Yul variables from stack to memory.
 * It takes a map from functions names and variable names to memory offsets.
 * It then transforms the AST as follows:
 *
 * Single variable declarations are replaced by mstore's as follows:
 *   If a is in the map, replace
 *     let a
 *   by
 *     mstore(<memory offset for a>, 0)
 *   respectively, replace
 *     let a := expr
 *   by
 *     mstore(<memory offset for a>, expr)
 *
 * In a multi-variable declaration, variables to be moved are replaced by fresh variables and then moved to memory:
 *   If b and d are in the map, replace
 *     let a, b, c, d := f()
 *   by
 *     let _1, _2, _3, _4 := f()
 *     mstore(<memory offset for d>, _4)
 *     mstore(<memory offset for b>, _2)
 *     let c := _3
 *     let a := _1
 *
 * Assignments to single variables are replaced by mstore's:
 *   If a is in the map, replace
 *     a := expr
 *   by
 *     mstore(<memory offset for a>, expr)
 *
 * Assignments to multiple variables are split up similarly to multi-variable declarations:
 *   If b and d are in the map, replace
 *     a, b, c, d := f()
 *   by
 *     let _1, _2, _3, _4 := f()
 *     mstore(<memory offset for d>, _4)
 *     mstore(<memory offset for b>, _2)
 *     c := _3
 *     a := _1
 *
 * Replace all references to a variable ``a`` in the map by ``mload(<memory offset for a>)``.
 *
 * If a visited function has arguments or return parameters that are contained in the map,
 * the entire function is skipped (no local variables in the function will be moved at all).
 *
 * Prerequisite: Disambiguator, ForLoopInitRewriter, FunctionHoister.
