[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then re-enable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

# ATTENTION: This list should be extended with care, consider using NOLINT comments inside your
# python files instead, as the goal is actually to reduce the list of globally disabled checks.
#
# TODO: What could be eliminated in future PRs: bad-continuation, invalid-name, redefined-builtin,
# undefined-variable, unused-*, useless-object-inheritance.
