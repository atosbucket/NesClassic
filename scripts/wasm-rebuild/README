This directory contains scripts that we used to rebuild historic releases to webassembly.
The rebuild took place at the time of Solidity version 0.6.1 and was used to rebuild all versions from 0.3.6 to 0.6.1.
The scripts are not actively tested or maintained, but we keep them for future reference in case we want to rebuild
historic releases again at a later point.
