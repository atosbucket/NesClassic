********************************
Solidity v0.6.0 Breaking Changes
********************************

This section highlights the main breaking changes introduced in Solidity
version 0.6.0, along with the reasoning behind the changes and how to update
affected code.
For the full list check
`the release changelog <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.0>`_.


Syntactic Only Changes
======================

This section lists purely syntactic changes that do not affect the behavior of existing code.

* Conversions from external function types to ``address`` are now disallowed. Instead external
  function types have a member called ``address``, similar to the existing ``selector`` member.

Semantic Only Changes
=====================

This section lists the changes that are semantic-only, thus potentially
hiding new and different behavior in existing code.


Semantic and Syntactic Changes
==============================

This section highlights changes that affect syntax and semantics.


How to update your code
=======================

This section gives detailed instructions on how to update prior code for every breaking change.

* Change ``address(f)`` to ``f.address`` for ``f`` being a variable of external function type.

Deprecated Elements
===================

This section lists changes that deprecate prior features or syntax.
