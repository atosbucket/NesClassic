How to update your code
=======================

This section gives detailed instructions on how to update prior code for every breaking change.

* Change ``f.value(...)()`` to ``f{value: ...}()``. Similarly ``(new C).value(...)()`` to
  ``(new C){value: ...}()`` and ``f.gas(...)()`` to ``f{gas: ...}()``.
* Change ``now`` to ``block.timestamp``.
* Change types of right operand in shift operators to unsigned types. For example change ``x >> (256 - y)`` to
  ``x >> uint(256 - y)``.
* Remove the ``public`` keyword from every constructor.
* Remove the ``internal`` keyword from every constructor and add ``abstract`` to the contract (if not already present).
