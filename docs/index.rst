Solidity
========

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart
contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts
within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a `curly-bracket language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Curly-bracket_languages>`_.
It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in
the :doc:`language influences <language-influences>` section.

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex
user-defined types among other features.

With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions,
and multi-signature wallets.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released
version of Solidity. Apart from exceptional cases, only the latest version receives
`security fixes <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/security/policy#supported-versions>`_.
Furthermore, breaking changes as well as
new features are introduced regularly. We currently use
a 0.x version number `to indicate this fast pace of change <https://semver.org/#spec-item-4>`_.

.. warning::

  Solidity recently released the 0.8.x version that introduced a lot of breaking
  changes. Make sure you read :doc:`the full list <080-breaking-changes>`.

Ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation are always welcome,
read our :doc:`contributors guide <contributing>` for more details.

Getting Started
---------------

**1. Understand the Smart Contract Basics**

If you are new to the concept of smart contracts we recommend you to get started by digging
into the "Introduction to Smart Contracts" section, which covers:

* :ref:`A simple example smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written in Solidity.
* :ref:`Blockchain Basics <blockchain-basics>`.
* :ref:`The Ethereum Virtual Machine <the-ethereum-virtual-machine>`.

**2. Get to Know Solidity**

Once you are accustomed to the basics, we recommend you read the :doc:`"Solidity by Example" <solidity-by-example>`
and “Language Description” sections to understand the core concepts of the language.

**3. Install the Solidity Compiler**

There are various ways to install the Solidity compiler,
simply choose your preferred option and follow the steps outlined on the :ref:`installation page <installing-solidity>`.

.. hint::
  You can try out code examples directly in your browser with the
  `Remix IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_. Remix is a web browser based IDE
  that allows you to write, deploy and administer Solidity smart contracts, without
  the need to install Solidity locally.

.. warning::
    As humans write software, it can have bugs. You should follow established
    software development best-practices when writing your smart contracts. This
    includes code review, testing, audits, and correctness proofs. Smart contract
    users are sometimes more confident with code than their authors, and
    blockchains and smart contracts have their own unique issues to
    watch out for, so before working on production code, make sure you read the
    :ref:`security_considerations` section.

**4. Learn More**

If you want to learn more about building decentralized applications on Ethereum, the
`Ethereum Developer Resources <https://ethereum.org/en/developers/>`_
can help you with further general documentation around Ethereum, and a wide selection of tutorials,
tools and development frameworks.

If you have any questions, you can try searching for answers or asking on the
`Ethereum StackExchange <https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/>`_, or
our `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity/>`_.
